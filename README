DESCRIPTION
===========

Ttc - Terminal Type Control -program, controls the logins on those  
terminal types, given as argument for the ttc. You can deny any terminal  
type you want and/or you can set timing for any terminal type you want.

Ttc is very handy when, for example, we want to deny logins from console 
except for some users, like root and administrators. Deny option has 
authorization check and if user passes it, user is able to login that 
terminal type what was marked as denied. If user fails authentication, 
session will be killed.

Other very useful option is timing. Using this option you can set timing 
to any tty you want to. This is very handy for example with serial lines. 
When users time is up, session will be killed. Timing option also has
authorization check. If user passes it, user will have no time limit. If
user fails authentication, default time limit is set for user. Timing
process is handled by ttc daemon program (ttcd).

Timing has also a time bank system. This means that user can have for
example 60 minutes time limit, for one day. If user uses all time limit,
he/she won't be able to login again during that day. At 00:00 all time
limit files will be removed and user is able to login again. User can use
the time limit in so many parts he/she wants during the day.

Time bank system can be disabled, when user has normal time limit but 
after time is up user is still able to login back again.

With ttc you can also control users logons on timed terminal types. This
means that if login limit is given, user is able to logon during that
day, that many times defined in login limit. After user has used his/her
login limit, user is not able to logon again. Login limit is combined with
time bank system, so when time limit files is removed, login limits are
set back up again.

Ttc also has a deny access option. You can deny some specific user to 
logon to some specific tty(s). This option should be used very carefully. 
More about this in README.TTC.


MORE INFORMATION AND INSTALLATION
=================================

A must read information before installation is README.TTC. This file
includes all the information how to use ttc and ttcd in general and how to
configure it.

Also, the ttc package now includes also ttc PAM module. This is a Pluggable 
Authentication Module that replaces ttc -program on those systems that run 
PAM library. These systems are Linux and Solaris. If you have PAM installed 
in your system it is recommended to install ttc PAM module. In this case, 
please also read README.PAM. Ttc PAM module replaces ttc -program but
it still uses ttcd -program, so make sure to read README.TTC also.

Read INSTALL for installation instructions.
