 INSTALLING TTC AND TTC DAEMON

================================

This file instructs compiling and installing ttc, ttcd and ttc PAM
module. Please also read README.TTC and README.PAM files.


CONFIGURING TTC AND TTC DAEMON
==============================

Before compiling it is a good idea to check out the configuration file.
Configuration file is config.h. That file includes all the possible 
configuration options you can do. I suggest checking config.h at the 
same time when reading this.


Configuring ttc
===============

DEFOPTION	Default options file is used when you run ttc without any
		arguments. Modify DEFOPTION if default (/etc/ttc.options)
		doesn't suite for you.

CONF_FILE	This is default configuration file (/etc/ttc.config). This
		file includes all configurations for ttc. (See README).
		Modify this if this doesn't suite for you.

There are some other configurable parts for ttc but they aren't really 
important. Check out config.h for them if you want to modify them.


Configuring ttcd
================

DEBUG		By default DEBUGing is defined. If you don't want any log
		messages then do #undef DEBUG. Log messages are saved
		int /var/lock/ttcdlog.

SOCKET_PATH	Path for ttcd socket. Default should suite for you too.

A_TIME		By modifying A_TIME, which is by default 60 minutes, you
		can set the time you want to give user to spare. This is
		the default time limit! Only integers are allowed!

A_MINUTES 	Is the time ttc waits before next round to check if user
		is still logged on and to add A_MINUTES to current time.
		Default is 1 minute, which is fine!

K_SECONDS 	Is the time after warning message is printed to user,  
		session will be killed. Default is 60 seconds.

Again, there are more configurable parts for ttcd too, but they aren't 
really important. Check out config.h for them if you want to modify them.


COMPILING AND INSTALLING
========================

Before compiling check that config.h and Makefile suites for you.

To compile and install ttc and ttcd, type:

make
make install

By default ttc and ttcd will be installed in /usr/local/bin. Edit
Makefile to change this default.


If your system supports PAM and it has been installed, then you might
want to install ttc PAM module. Read README.PAM for more information.
If your system doesn't support PAM or it hasn't been installed then you
can skip next two commands. To compile and install ttc PAM module, type:

make modules
make modules_install

By default ttc PAM module will be installed in /lib/security. Edit
Makefile to change this default, if you want to. Note that you still 
have to compile ttc and ttcd in order to ttc PAM module to work. Ttc 
PAM module replaces ttc -program but it still uses ttcd.


AFTER COMPILATION 
=================

If you are going to use ttc and ttcd then read after compilation
instructions from README.TTC.

If you are going to use ttc PAM module and ttcd then read after
compilation instructions from README.PAM.


UNINSTALLING
============

If you want to uninstall ttc and/or ttc PAM module from their default
locations you can do it by giving:

make uninstall
make modules_uninstall

This doesn't remove configuration files thus you need to remove them
by yourself.
